OVERVIEW
Soul Stone is a fantasy-themed battle arena game where players can compete, customize, craft, and trade as they pursue fun, fame, and fortune. This document covers the fundamental structure, gameplay, tokenomics, and roadmap for the development of Soul Stone.  It will be updated as game development progresses and more detailed information becomes available.


STRUCTURE
Soul Stone is developed with players in mind.  The ultimate goal for Soul Stone is to provide a gaming experience that keeps players coming back for years.  To this end, development is based on three guiding principles:

Games should be fun
Soul Stone is designed to be beautiful, exciting, and skill-based.  It is easy to learn and difficult to master.  Since unfairness is the bane of fun, Soul Stone avoids pay-to-win mechanics – many assets do have in-game utility, but they do not grant fundamental gameplay advantages.  Victory and defeat are determined by the player’s skill and strategy, not the player’s wealth.

Achievements should be celebrated
Players are rewarded for their feats (leveling up, completing challenges, etc.) with assets, tokens, and other perks.  Ranked leagues allow players to compete against other players for the fame and fortune that accompanies excellence.

Game economies should be open
Players have total ownership of their assets and tokens.  They can be bought, sold, and traded as they see fit.  Economic interactions between players are inevitable, so Soul Stone makes them an essential part of the game.  Buying, selling, and trading assets is not only accepted – it is encouraged.


GAMEPLAY
Soul Stone is structured as a battle arena.  Teams of players battle one another until only one team remains.  A team is eliminated once its soul stone is destroyed and all of its members are defeated.

Game Modes
Number of teams, sizes of teams, and other game conditions vary, depending on game mode.  

Examples:
War - Two teams of up to 32 players, infinite respawns
Attrition - Two teams of up to 32 players, finite respawns
Orcish Standoff - Three teams of up to 16 players, infinite respawns
Fireteam - Up to 25 teams of 4 players, infinite respawns
Free For All - Up to 100 players, no teams, no respawns

Crafting
Players can use their tokens to craft in-game assets (i.e. minting NFTs) of various types.  Crafting is randomized and costs MOTE.  Players can invest extra MOTE to boost their chances of getting particular traits in their items.

Equipment
Assets in this category define characters’ in-game functions and/or stats. 
Examples: weapons, armor, trinkets, and accessories

Scrolls
Assets in this category give players access to character techniques.
Examples: block, fireball, jab, etc.

Cosmetics
Assets in this category define the appearance of characters and their equipment.  
Examples: skins, emotes, death animations, and tags


TOKENOMICS
MOTE is Soul Stone’s utility token, and it is stored in three distinct pools.  The balance of these pools ensures that Soul Stone stays focused on the guiding principles while promoting a fair, open economy that generates value for all stakeholders.

Rewards Pool
The rewards pool is the birthplace of all MOTEs.  As players make achievements and contributions to the ecosystem, they are rewarded with MOTEs, which are distributed from the reward pool.

Players can earn MOTEs in several ways:
Leveling up their account
Completing challenges
Winning competitions

To guard against rapid inflation or deflation, MOTE’s reward pool is governed by a smart contract that maintains the pool’s supply of MOTEs within a range of [2-3] times the [30] day moving average of the entire player base’s earnings. When the reward pool exceeds that range, the smart contract burns the excess.  When the reward pool falls below that range, the smart contract mints more MOTEs.

The reward pool recaptures [80]% of the MOTEs that players spend in-game (e.g. purchases and crafting).

Incentives Pool
The purpose of the incentives pool is to fund efforts to maintain and grow the player base (e.g. air drops, marketing campaigns, staking rewards). It is governed by a DAO of MOTE stakers, and after [some road map event], it is funded exclusively by players’ in-game spending.  [10]% of MOTEs spent in-game are deposited in this pool.

Development Pool
The purpose of the development pool is to fund the maintenance and development of the game and its ecosystem (e.g. salaries, hardware, software, etc.). It is governed by the developers’ DAO, and (like the incentives pool), after [some road map event], it is funded exclusively by players’ in-game spending and royalties.  [10]% of MOTES spent in-game are deposited in this pool.

Player-Owned Assets
All game assets (MOTE, equipment, scrolls, and cosmetics) are tokenized and can be sold freely on the open market.  All asset sales incur a [10]% royalty fee, which is deposited in the development pool.



Getting Started
Soul Stone is free to play, but gameplay requires certain assets (see requirements section).  To ensure that startup costs never become prohibitively expensive for new players, the in-game store includes a low-cost (~$20) starter collection that includes all the basic assets needed to play the game.  New players may also assemble their own collection via the open market – the starter collection is not required in order to play.

Free riders: (people can mine materials during matches, but they lose it all if the team loses)
